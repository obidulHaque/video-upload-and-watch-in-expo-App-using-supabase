- **Expo-Video**: For smooth video playback.  

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

- Node.js and npm installed.  
- Expo CLI installed.  
- Supabase account and project setup.  

### Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/obidulHaque/video-upload-and-watch-in-expo-App-using-supabase.git

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
